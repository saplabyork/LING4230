<h2>Course Outline and Schedule</h2>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="course-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Course description:</h2>
<p>This course is a seminar surveying various topics in Language and the
Brain (or neurolinguistics more broadly). We examine questions like:
What are the mental processes that underlie language and what are their
behavioral correlates? What brain structures are associated with
language? We will read a text book as well as primary research articles,
both “classic” and current, that address various problems and issues in
linguistic functions and their neurological underpinnings. The course
follows the speech chain beginning with basic audition, speech
perception and phonological processing, into higher levels of syntactic
and semantic processing. The course also addresses research in
bi-/multilingualism as well as language disorders, such as aphasia.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-prerequisites" class="section level2">
<h2>Course prerequisites:</h2>
<p>You must have taken LING 2120 (Phonology), LING 2140 (Syntax 1) and
LING 3220/PSYC 3290 (Psycholinguistics) with grades of C+ or better; and
at least three additional credits in linguistics (AP/LING) at the 3000
level with grades of C+ or better. <strong>I will be checking these
prerequisites and you’ll be asked to drop the course if you do not have
them.</strong></p>
<!-- ## Learning outcomes: -->
<!-- 1. Demonstrate knowledge of the mechanics and physics of speech production and theories of perception -->
<!-- 2. Demonstrate knowledge of the concepts and methods used in the qualitative analysis of speech sounds -->
<!-- 3. Demonstrate knowledge of speech anatomy -->
<!-- 4. Demonstrate elementary knowledge of speech-language development and disorders -->
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your grade in the course will be determined by your performance on
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article questions (4 x 5% each)</li>
<li>Article presentations (15%)</li>
<li>Participation (10%)</li>
<li>Annotated bibliography (25%)</li>
<li>Final paper (30%)</li>

</div>
<div id="course-text-and-readings" class="section level2">
<h2>Course text and readings</h2>
<p>The course follows closely the materials and discussion in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brennan, Jonathan R. (2022) Language and the Brain: A slim guide to
neurolinguistics. (Oxford)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really good <a

</div>
<div id="eclass" class="section level2">
<h2>eClass</h2>
<p>All lectures (videos), lecture slides, assignments, discussion
boards, online Quizzes and Tests, and assignment submission will happen
on the <a href="http://eclass.yorku.ca">eClass</a> site for the course.
Lecture slides will be posted the evening after the lecture happens.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Class structure</h2>
<p>We will go over the day’s lecture and discuss issues and problems
presented in the chapter for the day. For the most part, the topics
discussed each week will follow closely the order of material presented
in the textbook, with additional readings discussed in conjunction with
the theme of the textbook chapter. It is critical that you do the
readings as they will surely illuminate what is discussed in the
lecture. Additionally, I ask that you forward me any interesting news
stories related to language which you might come across.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I will present for about an hour during each meeting. The
materials I will present will come directly from the textbook, with some
supplemental materials added</p></li>
<li><p>After my presentation there will be two to three student
presentations of primary research articles associated with each chapter.
For example, if the chapter is about word structure representation in
the brain, we will read a few articles directly reporting results of
experiments dealing with word structure. <strong>These articles will
then be presented by students.</strong> Each student will be responsible
for one presentation of an article during the term. The presentation
should be roughly 10-12 minutes long and MUST INCLUDE: the
<strong>question</strong> the article is addressing, the
<strong>method</strong> the researchers use to answer the question, the
<strong>results</strong> of the experiment, and the author’s
<strong>interpretation</strong> of the results. The presentation must
conclude with at least two discussion questions you might have about the
article. The articles themselves will be linked below. Students will be
randomly assigned to a particular article.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="article-questions" class="section level4">
<h4>Article questions</h4>
<p>Students are responsible for submitting <strong>four</strong> (4)
sets of questions for articles we read during the term. Any four
articles can be chosen by the student. Students should offer at least 2
(though more questions the better for your mark) questions about the
article. The questions should be informed and thoughtful. <strong>Do not
give me questions like “What about bilinguals?”</strong> or questions
that are extremely broad and scope. They can be questions about
methodology, previous research, interpretation of the data or the
conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>Questions must be submitted via the eClass submission portal on the
day we are discussing the particular article (by the beginning of
class). For example, if you choose to provide questions for a paper in
week 5, submit them at the start of week 5’s class. Questions must
include your name, the question set (i.e., “Set #2” if it’s the second
set of questions you’re submitting), and the article name and author in
the heading.</p>
<p>Please name your files like this:
YOUR_LAST_NAME-Week#-QuestionSet#.pdf</p>
<p>Each set of questions if worth 5% of your grade. If you submit
competent questions (and you do everything I ask regarding labeling the
question set, etc.) then you can expect to get full marks on the
assignment. That is, I’m not grading the quality of your questions per
se.</p>
<p><strong>You must have submitted questions for two (2) articles by
2/23.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="structure-of-journal-article-presentations"
class="section level4">
<h4>Structure of journal article presentations</h4>
<p>As explained above, student’s are responsible for one article
presentation during the term. The presentation should last around 10-12
minutes and shouldn’t exceed 20 slides. Please use <a
href="slides.google.com">slides.google.com</a> to compose your
presentation so that we can access it seamlessly in class. When you save
your file, besure to do so in the following manner:
“YOUR_LAST_NAME-ARTICLE_AUTHOR_NAME_Winter2026”. The general structure
of the presentation should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the problem/question asked by the article</li>
<li>Provide some background on what the article says has already been
done regarding this topic</li>
<li>Briefly explain the methodology used in the experiment</li>
<li>Explain the results of the experiment(s), using visuals like graphs
and plots, along with your own explanations</li>
<li>What does this mean for the original question being asked?</li>
<li>Any questions you might have about the research</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some sample presentations. Good ones: <a
href="Mauti-21_plasticity.pdf">this</a> and <a
href="LING%204320%20miglietta%202013.pdf">this</a>. Too much text on the
slides in <a href="LING%204230%20-%20presentation%20slides.pdf">this</a>
and <a href="article_20.pdf">this.</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: On the day of your presentation be sure to share the
Google Slides with me at <a href="mailto:chandann@gmail.com"
class="email">chandann@gmail.com</a>. This was I can pull up your
presentation in class.</p>
</div>
<div id="annotated-bibliography-and-final-paper" class="section level4">
<h4>Annotated bibliography and Final paper</h4>
<p>The final paper consists of two pieces of work: an annotated
bibliography and the paper itself. Your task will be to identify a
question that broadly (or narrowly) addresses a question in
neurolinguistics and propose a way to investigate it using either
behavioral or neuro-imaging methods (i.e., EEG, fMRI, etc.). Students,
<strong>in consultation with the me</strong> (please talk with me about
your ideas a few weeks into the course), will come up with a paper
topic. The paper will be a faux experimental paper that addresses a
particular question in-line with the readings done in class.</p>
<p>The paper should clearly articulate the history of the particular
line of thinking and approach to the topic. The paper will propose a
methodology and outline possible outcomes for the experimental study.
Some sample papers will be posted on line.</p>
<p>For the annotate bibliography and final paper you will work in PAIRS.
Please find a partner to work with. In special circumstances I will
allow you to work on your own.</p>
<p><strong>The Annotated bibliography is due, via eClass portal anytime
during Week 10</strong> <strong>The final paper is due by
XXX.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="email-policy" class="section level3">

<p>In the period between the last day to drop a course without receiving
a grade and the final day of classes in a term, undergraduate students
are permitted to withdraw from a course with the condition that the
course enrolment remains on a student’s transcript, denoted by a “W” in
the University’s records and on the student’s transcript as the grade
decision. No credit value will be retained for the course and no value
will be included in the calculation of a student’s grade point average
(GPA). Please go <a
