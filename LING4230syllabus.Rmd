# **LING 4230: Language and the Brain**\
Instructor: [Chandan Narayan](https://ch-narayan.github.io)\
Office hours: Mondays noon-1 or Wednesdays on Zoom (email to set up appt) [Zoom link](https://yorku.zoom.us/j/97755816919?pwd=L1krNjJlUm9TL2RWWE1HWnZwNXZLQT09)\

## Course Outline and Schedule

***

## Course description:
This course is a seminar surveying various topics in Language and the Brain (or neurolinguistics more broadly). We examine questions like: What are the mental processes that underlie language and what are their behavioral correlates? What brain structures are associated with language? We will read a text book as well as primary research articles, both “classic” and current, that address various problems and issues in linguistic functions and their neurological underpinnings. The course follows the speech chain beginning with basic audition, speech perception and phonological processing, into higher levels of syntactic and semantic processing. The course also addresses research in bi-/multilingualism as well as language disorders, such as aphasia.

## Course prerequisites:
You must have taken LING 2120 (Phonology), LING 2140 (Syntax 1) and LING 3220/PSYC 3290 (Psycholinguistics) with grades of C+ or better; and at least three additional credits in linguistics (AP/LING) at the 3000 level with grades of C+ or better. **I will be checking these prerequisites and you'll be asked to drop the course if you do not have them.**

<!-- ## Learning outcomes: -->

<!-- 1. Demonstrate knowledge of the mechanics and physics of speech production and theories of perception -->
<!-- 2. Demonstrate knowledge of the concepts and methods used in the qualitative analysis of speech sounds -->
<!-- 3. Demonstrate knowledge of speech anatomy -->
<!-- 4. Demonstrate elementary knowledge of speech-language development and disorders -->

## Evaluation

Your grade in the course will be determined by your performance on the following:

* Article questions (4 x 5% each)
* Article presentations (15%)
* Participation (10%)
* Annotated bibliography (25%)
* Final paper (30%)

## Course text and readings
The course follows closely the materials and discussion in:

> Brennan, Jonathan R. (2022) Language and the Brain: A slim guide to neurolinguistics. (Oxford) 

This is really good [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0iakfexfuy2c2jhlep1kt/Oxford-Linguistics-Jonathan-R.-Brennan-Language-and-the-Brain_-A-Slim-Guide-to-Neurolinguistics-Oxford-University-Press-2022-Copy.pdf?rlkey=vlqhbmedoi6zr3b1fj0l1ybq5&st=ml2mym32&dl=0).

## eClass
All lectures (videos), lecture slides, assignments, discussion boards, online Quizzes and Tests, and assignment submission will happen on the [eClass](http://eclass.yorku.ca) site for the course. Lecture slides will be posted the evening after the lecture happens.


## Class structure
We will go over the day's lecture and discuss issues and problems presented in the chapter for the day. For the most part, the topics discussed each week will follow closely the order of material presented in the textbook, with additional readings discussed in conjunction with the theme of the textbook chapter. It is critical that you do the readings as they will surely illuminate what is discussed in the lecture. Additionally, I ask that you forward me any interesting news stories related to language which you might come across.

1) I will present for about an hour during each meeting. The materials I will present will come directly from the textbook, with some supplemental materials added

2) After my presentation there will be two to three student presentations of primary research articles associated with each chapter. For example, if the chapter is about word structure representation in the brain, we will read a few articles directly reporting results of experiments dealing with word structure. **These articles will then be presented by students.** Each student will be responsible for one presentation of an article during the term. The presentation should be roughly 10-12 minutes long and MUST INCLUDE: the **question** the article is addressing, the **method** the researchers use to answer the question, the **results** of the experiment, and the author's **interpretation** of the results. The presentation must conclude with at least two discussion questions you might have about the article. The articles themselves will be linked below. Students will be randomly assigned to a particular article. 

#### Article questions

Students are responsible for submitting **four** (4) sets of questions for articles we read during the term. Any four articles can be chosen by the student. Students should offer at least 2 (though more questions the better for your mark) questions about the article. The questions should be informed and thoughtful. **Do not give me questions like "What about bilinguals?"** or questions that are extremely broad and scope. They can be questions about methodology, previous research, interpretation of the data or the conclusions drawn.

Questions must be submitted via the eClass submission portal on the day we are discussing the particular article (by the beginning of class). For example, if you choose to provide questions for a paper in week 5, submit them at the start of week 5's class. Questions must include your name, the question set (i.e., "Set #2" if it's the second set of questions you're submitting), and the article name and author in the heading. 

Please name your files like this: YOUR_LAST_NAME-Week#-QuestionSet#.pdf

Each set of questions if worth 5% of your grade. If you submit competent questions (and you do everything I ask regarding labeling the question set, etc.) then you can expect to get full marks on the assignment. That is, I'm not grading the quality of your questions per se.

**You must have submitted questions for two (2) articles by 2/23.**

#### Structure of journal article presentations

As explained above, student's are responsible for one article presentation during the term. The presentation should last around 10-12 minutes and shouldn't exceed 20 slides. Please use [slides.google.com](slides.google.com) to compose your presentation so that we can access it seamlessly in class. When you save your file, besure to do so in the following manner: "YOUR_LAST_NAME-ARTICLE_AUTHOR_NAME_Winter2026". The general structure of the presentation should be:

* Introduce the problem/question asked by the article
* Provide some background on what the article says has already been done regarding this topic
* Briefly explain the methodology used in the experiment
* Explain the results of the experiment(s), using visuals like graphs and plots, along with your own explanations
* What does this mean for the original question being asked?
* Any questions you might have about the research

Here are some sample presentations. Good ones: [this](Mauti-21_plasticity.pdf) and [this](LING 4320 miglietta 2013.pdf). Too much text on the slides in [this](LING 4230 - presentation slides.pdf) and [this.](article_20.pdf)

IMPORTANT: On the day of your presentation be sure to share the Google Slides with me at chandann@gmail.com. This was I can pull up your presentation in class. 

#### Annotated bibliography and Final paper

The final paper consists of two pieces of work: an annotated bibliography and the paper itself. Your task will be to identify a question that broadly (or narrowly) addresses a question in neurolinguistics and propose a way to investigate it using either behavioral or neuro-imaging methods (i.e., EEG, fMRI, etc.). Students, **in consultation with the me** (please talk with me about your ideas a few weeks into the course), will come up with a paper topic. The paper will be a faux experimental paper that addresses a particular question in-line with the readings done in class. 

The paper should clearly articulate the history of the particular line of thinking and approach to the topic. The paper will propose a methodology and outline possible outcomes for the experimental study.
Some sample papers will be posted on line.

For the annotated bibliography and final paper you will work in PAIRS. Please find a partner to work with. In special circumstances I will allow you to work on your own. 

The Annotate bibliography should reflect *at least* ten sources. There is no specific page count or word count, as long as you communicate the main findings of each paper you should be good. Most of the research you will be consiulting will have detailed methodology and statistical analysis. Your AB should not include this information, but rather it should reflect the question of the article, how it was addressed (what methods were used), the results and the authors' interpretation. 

[Here](https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/annotated-bibliography/) is a nice tutorial on how to write an annotate bibliography. Make sure your references are in APA style. 

* Here is a sample [Annotated Bibliography](LING4230_SampleAB.pdf)
* Here are sample papers: [1](EXPERIMENTAL_PAPER_MODEL1.pdf), [2](EXPERIMENTAL_PAPER_MODEL2.pdf)

**The Annotated bibliography is due, via eClass portal anytime during Week 10**
**The final paper is due by XXX.**

### Email policy
If you cannot attend the scheduled office hour, contact me to arrange another time. I will do my best to answer your phone and email messages promptly. I do not, generally, answer email on the weekend. Please email me from your yorku.ca account and put ‘LING 4230’ in the subject line. Emails sent from non-York accounts will be ignored. Please sign your emails; I will not reply to anonymous messages. My response to your email may be brief and may not come within 48 hours. **Please be patient**.

## Grading
York University uses a grading system detailed [here](http://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2012-2013/academic/grades/). Please familiarize yourself with it. 

## Academic Honesty and Integrity
York students are required to maintain high standards of academic integrity and are subject to the Senate Policy on Academic Honesty. Please review the documents available [here](https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/). Academic offences are treated very seriously, and the disciplinary procedures are described there as well. Please consult the code if you have any question about the nature of academic offences and their penalties.

## Course Withdrawal (W) option
In the period between the last day to drop a course without receiving a grade and the final day of classes in a term, undergraduate students are permitted to withdraw from a course with the condition that the course enrolment remains on a student’s transcript, denoted by a “W” in the University’s records and on the student’s transcript as the grade decision. No credit value will be retained for the course and no value will be included in the calculation of a student's grade point average (GPA). Please go [here](https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/course-withdrawal) for details.
