## MT Practice problem answers

1. Suppose you have a tube that's closed at one end. The frequency of the 5th resonance is 0.05kHz. Assuming that the speed of sound is 330m/s, what is the length of the tube in cm? [Answer](images/prac_1.pdf)

2. What is the dB reading for a sound with an intensity of 0.01 W/m2 [Answer](images/prac_2.pdf)

3. A gas that has a volume of 5 ml at 3 atm at sea level will have a what volume at the top of Mt. Everest, where the pressure drops by 0.3 atm? [Answer](images/prac_3.pdf)

 (5ml)(3atm) =x(2.7atm)
 x=15/2.7=5.56ml
